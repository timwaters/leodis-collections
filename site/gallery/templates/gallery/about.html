    <h2>Leodis Collections</h2>
    <p>Leodis Collections is a view into the <a href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/libraries">Leeds Library Information Service</a> photo archive <a href="http://leodis.net">Leodis.net</a>, in showing the changing shape of the City of Leeds. You can view a range of curated photos for a number of collections or themes. The collections are Arcades, Parks, Public Houses, Cinemas and Shopping. Most of the photos have been added to a map and each collection has a map view. Leodis Collections is a pilot website to showcase a range of interesting photos from the Leeds Library Photography Collection of the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, UK. It is a product of the Leeds City Council's Innovation Labs  - collaborations between local technologists and Council departments. </p>

    <p>This site is developed and hosted by Tim Waters, a Leeds based freelance web developer in collaboration with Library and Information Service.</p>
